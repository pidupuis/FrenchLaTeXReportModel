	abstract = {Understanding the functions of proteins requires information about their protein-protein interactions {(PPI).} The collective effort of the scientific community generates far more data on any given protein than individual experimental approaches. The latter are often too limited to reveal an interactome comprehensively. We developed a workflow for parallel mining of all major {PPI} databases, containing data from several model organisms, and to integrate data from the literature for a protein of interest. We applied this novel approach to build the {PPI} network of the human Hsp90 molecular chaperone machine {(Hsp90Int)} for which previous efforts have yielded limited and poorly overlapping sets of interactors. We demonstrate the power of the {Hsp90Int} database as a discovery tool by validating the prediction that the Hsp90 co-chaperone Aha1 is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Thus, we both describe how to build a custom database and introduce a powerful new resource for the scientific community.},
